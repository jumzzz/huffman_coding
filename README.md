# Huffman Coding
Implementation of Huffman Coding in Rust

## Implemented Parts
- Given a Vector of Arbitrary Characters with corresponding Probabilities, generate the appropriate Huffman Code
- Testing against Source Coding Theorem
- Testing against Uniform Distribution of 8 Samples

## Test

To run the test simply

```
cargo test -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

### Test Cases

Here are the following test case

1. Uniform Distribution with 8 Samples
2. Shannon Source Coding Theorem
